vlock (2.2.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  This update disables the new.so plugin and thus the --new switch, because it
  proved too hard to fix it properly. See #702705.

vlock (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  vlock 2.0 expands the user's ability to lock a machine in two ways. First is
  the ability to lock the entire console display without access to a virtual
  console, i.e. from an X11 or even an SSH session. Secondly, SysRQ keys may be
  disabled while the entire console display is locked. These two operations are
  priviledged and should be restricted. Therefore, to be allowed to do either
  of these a user must be added to the group 'vlock'. See
  /usr/share/doc/vlock/SECURITY for more information.
